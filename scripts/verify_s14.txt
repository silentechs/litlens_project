// This is a temporary file to check DB structure if needed, or just reading schema.prisma again.
// Actually, I already checked schema.prisma and confirmed Unique constraints.
// S14: Duplicate Decision Prevention.
// Constraint: @@unique([projectWorkId, reviewerId, phase]) on ScreeningDecisionRecord.
// This prevents multiple decisions for same phase/reviewer.
// The code in DecisionValidator checks memory, but the DB constraint is the real guard.
// So S14 is effectively "Resolved by DB Constraint".
// However, the audit said "Potential race condition".
// DB constraint handles the race condition (one will fail with UniqueConstraintViolation).
// I should handle that error in screening-service?
// Currently: `await this.deps.repository.createDecision(...)`.
// If it throws, the service throws.
// User gets error.
// That is acceptable behavior for race condition (optimistic locking equivalent).
